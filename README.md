# chosen-family

Your Chosen Family is not 


An inclusive, open-source alternative to GEDCOM for family trees and genealogical information.

- Track biological/genealogical data as well as your "chosen family", including godparents, partners, etc.
- Inclusive gender/pronoun support and a wide range of living rangements
- Support for blended families, in-laws, divorces, multiple partners, guardianships, adoptions, and step-and-half siblings.

Data is stored as JSON. 

Included in this proposed standard are basic graph support (Using Cypher).

- Basic transformation of family JSON data into network graph. 
- Automatically add inferred relationships
    - For example, if you enter your spouse and children, sibling relationships will be inferred.
- Automatically generate the proper named relationship between any two members of a graph.
- Support for multiple languages
- Customizable named relationship data (If you want to call "an aunt" "a titi")
- Generating standard "family tree" views.



## What is GEDCOM

The defacto standard for tracking genealogical data was made in the mid-90's by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

I personally find some of the beliefs and standards of the LDS church to lack inclusivity, compassion, and openness to modern family structures.


#### How can you help?
This is a project I am working on because I didn't find any solid alternative.
Please let me know if you want to contribute OR if you find a solid alternative. 

Once I have a standardized format for language support,
I would appreciate help with adding translations of relationships in multiple languages.
